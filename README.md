# HOLLOW-PASSAGE-Text-Based-Adventure-Game-

A bite-sized text adventure with three locations (foyer, landing, basement) and three items (candle, key, front door). You are a lost soul and your goal is to escape the haunted foyer. Pick up and light the candle to keep the dark at bay, brave the basement to retrieve the key, then unlock and open the front door to win. Beware: entering the basement without a lit candle results in a swift and spooky demise.
I have always enjoyed old school survival horror games such as resident evil and silent hill. I knew that some of the earliest survival games were point and click text based games so i just wanted to make something small with a similarly eery vibe.

This snippet was a part of my interactive fiction and text generation course where I modified a version of action castle in order to create my own unique snippet of a text adventure game.
